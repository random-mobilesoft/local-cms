<h3><span style="color: #399cf8;">Case Study: Rainesforest Massage</span></h3>
<h4>About Rainesforest Massage Day Spa</h4>
Rainesforest Massage is already a very successful massage and day-spa offering a variety of treatments, packages and service to the whole family, local, national and international travellers. They have a loyal following and maintain a consistent level of care and service to every individual. When checking out their Analytics, Rainesforestâ€™s online marketing team noticed that they were getting just shy of 30% of visitors from mobile devices, and this provided the incentive to implement a Mobile website.
<h4>The Challenge</h4>
Providing a mobile friendly website that captured the main points from the website and also provided the main details people would call about. Which is where are you? What days are you open and what other services or specials do you have?
<h4>The goMobi Solution</h4>
By optimizing the main features and categories on the main website, this mobile site is a fantastic example of how to maintain that consistent level of care and loyalty by helping their customers click on exactly what they are looking for right then and there with no delay.
<h4>Results</h4>
Rainesforest Massage has seen all areas of the business increase in traffic, with results going through the roof! They have had increased Bookings, due to people using the mobile site to book. A phenomenal amount of people using the Map to get to the establishment and repeat visitors consistently viewing the daily specials. Overall a fantastic representation of how to leverage the power of mobile.
