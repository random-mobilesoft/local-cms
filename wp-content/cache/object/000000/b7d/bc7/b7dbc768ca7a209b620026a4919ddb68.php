<h3><span style="color: #399cf8;">Case Study: The Carron</span></h3>
“I’m surprised by the large number of people finding our venue via our Mobile Site. It pays for itself every month.”

Jamie Bennett, owner of The Carron
<h4>About The Carron Tavern</h4>
A haven exists on Spencer Street, tucked near some of the biggest sporting and entertainment venues in Melbourne. The Carron caters to the likes of alternative rock goers, after work business folk and those consuming a few brews before heading off to Ethiad Stadium. Well known for its function room equipped with balcony, own bar and a void that looks down over the dining areas below.
<h4>The Challenge</h4>
Given The Carron is right in the heart of the city it is surrounded with competition and business affiliates in the area. Trying to draw customers back for functions is desirable so promoting this space to the locals is very important. They don’t want to just be known as the ‘before’ we head out pub, but one that people make as a destination for any occasion.
<h4>The goMobi Solution</h4>
Promoting the function space with links for enquiries, menu’s and location based mapping as well as keeping locals up to date with local events that are happening on social media. Opening hours are a big one too, as race goers, rock stars, and footy crowds gather before events. Reminding them The Carron is very important.
<h4>Results</h4>
Implementing these features has brought new locals and more event patrons. Being close to entertainment/leisure services and having an optimizing mobile site to suit has made The Carron Tavern stand out as the local to be at. Since the Launch of the goMobi site, bookings and patronage has gone from strength to strength.
