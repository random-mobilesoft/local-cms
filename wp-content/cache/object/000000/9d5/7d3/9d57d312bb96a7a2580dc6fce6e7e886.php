This excellent video was created for Group M, the parent of Maxus, MEC, MediaCom, Mindshare and Xaxis, by <a href="http://www.seenvision.net/"><b>Seen Vision</b></a>, using data from the <a href="http://www.wpp.com/wpp/press/2013/jul/11/groupm-says-smartphones-are-chineses-newest-significant-other"><b>Group M Interaction survey</b></a> (July 2013) and various third-party stats.

The survey, conducted by <a href="http://www.decision-fuel.com/"><b>Decision Fuel</b></a>, collected data from 981 Chinese smartphone users by mobile phone, which is a large enough sample to give a meaningful indication of whatâ€™s happening in the worldâ€™s number 1 mobile market. Itâ€™s also good to see mobile data being collected by m-research.

The video takes the viewer through the mobile day with lots of wow stats with data from its own survey, intermingled with stats from elsewhere. The stats from the video are transcribed below the video. The sources arenâ€™t made clear in the video, but mobiThinking has identified some, and hopes to make the rest clear with the help of Group M.
